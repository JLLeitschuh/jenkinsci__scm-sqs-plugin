Configure Jenkins to monitor an Amazon SQS queue for messages.  Jenkins will start a new build
if a message is posted to the queue and the message's content matches this job's repository and
branch. The repository should be set up to post messages to the queue whenever changes are made.
<p/>
Available queues can be configured in Jenkins'
<a href="/jenkins/configure">System Configuration</a>.
<p/>
Further documentation is available in the
<a href="https://github.com/mwaylabs/scm-sqs-plugin">SCM SQS Plugin repository</a> on GitHub.
